/*
The "Become a Billionaire" decentralized Raffle v0.9, pre-release.
~by Gluedog
-----------

The weekly Become a Billionaire decentralized raffle will be the basis of the deflationary mechanism for Billionaire Token.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every week, users can send 10 XBL to an Ethereum Smart Contract address – this is the equivalent of buying one ticket,
    more tickets mean a better chance to win. Users can buy an unlimited number of tickets to increase their chances.
    At the end of the week, the Smart Contract will choose three winners at random. First place will get 40% of
    the tokens  that were raised during that week, second place gets 20% and third place gets 10%.
    From the remaining 30% of the tokens: 10% are burned – as an offering to the market gods. The other 20% are sent
    to another Smart Contract Address that works like a twisted faucet – rewarding people for burning their own coins.

The Become a Billionaire raffle Smart Contract will run forever, and will have an internal timer that will reset
    itself every seven days. The players are registered to the Raffle by creating an internal mapping,
    inside the Smart Contract, a mapping of every address that registers tokens to it and their associated
    number of tickets. This mapping is reset every time the internal timer resets (every seven days).
